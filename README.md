An alien must jump atop a block hill to ride down a flag pole.

I followed Colton Ogden's Lua and Love2d Tutorial to create the main game, then implemented a half-pyramid and flagpole with victory conditions.
I added a few niceties like a "run" button and allowing for jumping through clouds (initially the sprite hits it and causes the bump sound).

A program based on [specifications](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/games/mario/ "Substitution Cipher") given by HarvardX's online cs50 course.
